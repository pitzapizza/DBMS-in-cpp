WELCOME EVERYONE!
WE ARE USING QT software FOR CREATING OUR OWN DATABASE IN C++, THE UI IS DESIGNED TO WORK LIKE EXCEL, YOU WILL NEED TO FIRST CREATE YOUR OWN ACCOUNT IN THE LOGIN/SIGN UP PAGE. THIS IS A BASIC PROGRAM SO I SUGGEST U TO TRY IT WITH SIMPLE NAMES AND PASSWORD AS ALL THE LOGIN DETAILS IS ONL STROED LOCALLY IN YOUR SYSTEM AND NOT IN OTHER SYSTEMS. 

HAVE FUN
